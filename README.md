**Question:**
At the end of the tutorial, we saw that the modeled PRO biomass decreases with subsequent transfers. This is not in agreement with what we see in the lab, where the PRO in the controls (just PRO without SYN)  has similar growth in all transfers. 
a) Using the current model PRO parameters, how long will it take for PRO to go extinct (how many transfers)? 
b) The current PRO parameters are based on a lab experiment performed under slightly different conditions than the experiment described here. Specifically, the light intensity (which drives the maximum growth rate) was different. Therefore, it makes sense to modify the PRO Vmax so that the modeled cells do not go extinct. Your mission is to adjust the PRO Vmax to ensure that the modeled cells are not driven to extinction over successive transfers. How would you test what the minimal PRO Vmax is that would enable PRO to grow consistently in all transfers. What is the new Vmax value? How did you select it? Demonstrate with an appropriate figure.
