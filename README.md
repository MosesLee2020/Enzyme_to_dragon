**Question:**
In the real-life experiment, SYN was dominant at the end of the 7th transfer (Slide 5 in the link above).</p>
a) Can you reproduce this experimental outcome in the model, using the model with the PRO parameters from question (2)? Which SYN parameters did you change to try to replicate the outcome? </p>
b) What ranges or distributions of parameter values did you explore, and how did you choose these ranges? </p>
c) Which parameters had the strongest influence on SYNâ€™s dominance, and how did changes in these parameters affect the outcome? </p>
d) Please present your results in a figure, which can include multiple panels if needed.</p>
