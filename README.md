# Final assignment

The goal of this assignment is to enable you to revisit the main concepts of mechanistic modelling using differential equations as we discussed in the course, and to think how to adapt them to a slightly more complex setting - competition between two phytoplankton (PRO and SYN) in serial transfers of the laboratory cultures. </p>

Please re-acquaint yourselves with the research question we discussed in class. We also recommend that you revisit the phytoplankton growth tutorials we did in class. Please make sure you understand how to model the two phytoplankton species, and how to implement the transfer from one test tube to a subsequent one. You may use the code in the tutorial as a starting point to answer the questions.
